This is actually an alpha version of dvips 5.83 which has been tested
since last November.  This version is stable enough to be released
and the dvips author (Tomas Rokicki) permitted a public release of this
version.  The source of this alpha version is available from

 http://www.radicaleye.com/dvipsalpha.html

as of today and you may not able to find it on the usual CTAN site.

This new version has many enhancements and bug fixes.

Please note that the default resolution of "config.ps" has been
changed to 600 dpi laserjetIV from 300 dpi laserjet.
Please don't forget to backup your configuration files under
emTeX\data\dvips\* before installing this package.
