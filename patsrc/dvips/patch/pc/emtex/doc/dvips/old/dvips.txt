DVIPS.DOC                    PC-DVIPS 5.58                OS/2, DOS, Win

========================================================================




1.   S Y S T E M - R E Q U I R E M E N T S 
==========================================

* IBM PC compatible computer, running DOS, OS/2 (>= 2.0) or Windows.

* The filesystem is created for emTeX (>June 95), if you want to 
  use dvips under other TeX implementations, you may need reading section
  'Support of other TeX distributions'.



2.   I N S T A L L A T I O N
============================

2.1  Your first installation

Change to the drive (root directory), where emTeX is already installed, 
unzip the archives with unzip! (unzip is part of the emtex distribution,
here unzip means one of the your system matching executable, e.g. unzip32.exe):
        > unzip dvipsini.zip    (.exe, .bat, .sty, .tex, ..., 
                                 at least all you need to run dvips)
        > unzip dvipsfnt.zip    (virtual fonts and tfm files)
        > unzip dvipssrc.zip    (additional sources and patches)
The files become extracted into 
        \emtex          and subdirectories and
        \texfonts       and subdirectories.
If you want to use other directrories, proceed as described in the emtex
documentation.


2.2  Updating from dps558[bs] and dvipslib

I would recommend the following procedure of updating. Use the 
emremove.exe (from current emtex distribution):
        > emremove -k \emtex\remove\dps558b.rem c:\
        > emremove -k \emtex\remove\dps558s.rem c:\
        > emremove -k \emtex\remove\dvipslib.rem c:\
The -k option keeps changed files. Save these files left. Install the 
new dvips packages and change the new files with respect of your
modifications of former versions. This normally affects config.ps, 
dvips.bat/cmd and maketexp.bat/cmd.
NOTE:   dvips.{bat,cmd} are no more included in this distribution.
        Config/Header files have moved into \emtex\data\dvips


2.3  Updating from dvips.zip or dvipssrc.zip, dvipsexe.zip dvipsfnt.zip
     (all 'beta' versions from 2.1 to 2.3x)

Use
        > emremove -k \emtex\remove\dvips.rem c:\
or
        > emremove -k \emtex\remove\dvipssrc.rem c:\
        > emremove -k \emtex\remove\dvipsexe.rem c:\
        > emremove -k \emtex\remove\dvipslib.rem c:\
instead for removing the files.


*** REMOVE THE SPECIFICATION OF ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
***             TEXCONFIG 
*** FROM YOUR AUTOEXEC.BAT OR CONFIG.SYS !!!
***
*** This value is obsolete, dvips searches now its config files in
*** $(EMTEXDIR)\data\dvips or \emtex\data\dvips by default.


2.4  Installation of 32Bit extenders EMX or RSX

The 32Bit executables make use of so called extenders. These could be 
EMX.DLL under OS/2, EMX.EXE under DOS, RSX.EXE under DOS with DPMI (Dos 
Protected Mode Interface), RSX.EXE -- or better RSXWIN.EXE -- under MS 
Windows (3.0...NT). When you have already installed emTeX you have also
installed the emxrsx.zip, comming together with emTeX. In this case step 
over the rest of this subsection.

When you need to install the emxrsx package, you should upload 
        CTAN:/tex-archive/systems/msdos/emtex/emxrsx.zip.
and unpack the archive on your emtex drive
        > unzip emxrsx
You'll find the documentation for emx in \emx\doc\emxrt.doc and for rsx 
in \emtex\doc\rsx\*.txt. What's to do in brief is:
        Add c:\emx\bin;c:\emtex\bin to your PATH variable
Under OS/2
        add c:\emx\dll to the LIBPATH statement of your config.sys
Under DOS
        remove BREAK=ON from config.sys
Next reboot the system for the changes taking effect.

If your DOS system is based upon a 32bit processor *without* a coprocessor,
i.e. plain 386, 486SX and you want to use the 32bit executable for any 
reason under EMX, you need to install the complete 'emxrt.zip' package. 
emxrt's home site is
        ftp://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/systems/os2/emx-0.9a/emxrt.zip
It contains the FPU emulator that is required in this case.




3.   D O C U M E N T A T I O N
==============================

If you want to use dvips for the first time, it might be really the right 
moment to read its handbook \emtex\doc\dvips\dvips.{tex,dvi}. This book helps
a lot when dvips won't do the job you intend and one learns much about its
power, options and controls. A copy of this file (dvips.doc) file is in
\emtex\doc\dvips\dvips.doc and information about building dvips yourself 
can be found in \emtex\src\dvihps\read_me.




4.   E N V I R O N M E N T   V A R I A B L E S
==============================================

dvips itself uses lots of variables if present. Here, only the variables 
used by dvips to load configuration files and used by the batch and config.ps 
files of this distribution are mentioned.

name              default
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
EMTEXDIR          \emtex
This value should already be set for your emTeX system. The config.ps 
file refers often to that value as base path for all the necessary 
subdirectories.

DVIDRVFONTS       \texfonts
This value  *must*  contain only a single path and is usually already
in use for your emTeX system. (this *must* has nothing to do with emTeX, 
it comes from the use of this value in maketexp.{bat.cmd}.)
It is used by the maketexp scripts and by config.ps. It points to the 
base path for pk font files and font libraries.

DVIPS_STDERR      
This is new. If required, DVIPS_STDERR should be set to a filename.
dvips redirects its stderr output (all messages on the screen) into
this file. This is my gift for all these DOS people, who cannot
redirect stderr to a file using command.com.

TEXCONFIG         $(EMTEXDIR)\data\dvips
Where dvips searches for its config.ps, *.cfg and *.map files.

DVIDRVGRAPH       
GS_LIB            
These values are not required, but are used in config.ps as additional 
possible path entries where dvips could find 'header' files, such as .eps
graphics or PostScript fonts files. (GS_LIB is used by GhostScript.)

MAKETEXPK         maketexpk %n %d %b %m
see section 'Automatic generation of fonts'

T1FONTS          c:\psfonts
This is used by the make_pk REXX script to locate the PostScript 
type1-font source file for a missing font, see 'Automatic generation of 
fonts'

HOME             
This is the directory, dvips searches for the user configuration file 
dvips.ini in some cases (see next section).

PRINTER          
If this variable is set, dvips tries to load the file $(PRINTER).cfg
instead of dvips.ini directly after loading config.ps.




5.   R U N N I N G   D V I P S
==============================

The default path names dvips uses is now based upon the two important emtex
environment variables only.

EMTEXDIR points to the path where all emtex related stuff has been installed,
this defaults to \emtex if not set.
Example:        set EMTEXDIR=f:\emtex

DVIDRVFONTS points to the pk fonts and fli files emtex's device driver use.
This defaults to \texfonts if not set.
Example:        set DVIDRVFONTS=f:\texfonts

After loading config.ps, dvips checks if the user has set the environment 
variable PRINTER, in this case it loads the file $(PRINTER).cfg if
possible from the $(TEXCONFIG) directory. If no PRINTER value has been 
set, dvips tries to open dvips.ini from the config path -- or when
$(HOME) has a value from there instead.
NOTE: dvips.ini becomes not loaded, when PRINTER has a value and/or an expicit
configuration has been specified by the -P<printer> commandline option.

Once the installation is complete and the EMTEXDIR value is set, test
if dvips runs (which should happen on a standard emTeX installation :-)
The plain command
        > dvips16
shows you version and options of the 16bit dvips.exe program and/or
        > dvips32
for the 32bit version.

If this does not work, see -> Problems A) below.
If anything worked fine, you are ready for the next steps.
('dvips' means either dvips16.exe or dvips32.exe)
        > cd \emtex\doc\dvips
        > dvips adjust       (you'll get 'adjust.ps')
        > dvips dvips        (and dvips.ps)
If this fails, you should read -> Problems B) below, otherwise print 
adjust.ps as usual on a PostScript device or via GhostScript. Check if 
the papersize is set correctly in your config.ps file.




6.   P R O B L E M S
====================

6.1  dvips32 does not run at all

- If you have problems with DPMI (usually under Windows) messages like: 
  'rsx not found, DPMI not supported by emx' you should install and use
  rsx.exe instead of emx.exe by
        > set RSX=C:\RSX\BIN\RSX.EXE
  see also: c:\emtex\doc\rsx\install.txt, c:\emx\doc\emxrt.doc)

- If you do not have installed a numerical coprocessor under DOS (dvips 
  stops with '... SIGFPE ...') EMX is unable to activate its fpu emulation.
  Try using RSX instead, but you need a DPMI server. Otherwise check first, 
  if you are running EMX in revision 30 or higher with
        > set EMXOPT=-V
        > dvips32
  look at the first output line. The file emxfpemu should be in %EMXPATH%,
  usually c:\emx\bin. I' like to recommend using the 16Bit executable of
  dvips16.exe (by Eberhard Mattes), which runs faster in this case.


6.2  dvips16.exe / dvips32.exe runs but gives errors

- Some environment variables or the corresponding values in config.ps
  have not been correctly set, that means dvips can not find files, fonts
  or whatever. Call dvips with its debug option '-d 2' which reports the
  path search for more information.
  The -d 2 option has been improved:
  - Any replacement of default values or values from config files by
    environment variables is reported.
  - The directory lists used by emtex's search routines are shown.
  - The results of filesearching are reported.

  For further information you may find the '-d 64' option useful, that reports
  all (which could be really many!) files dvips tries to open.

  If you are running dvips under DOS and you don't like so much messages
  scrolling over your screen, use 'SET DVIPS_STDERR=dvips.log' to redirect
  the output to a file dvips.log.
  (after debugging: 'SET DVIPS_STDERR=' :-)

  Possibly some dvips assumptions are not correct. Check
  \emtex\bin\set-tex.{bat,cmd} and/or the settings in autoexec.bat or
  config.sys, especially the values EMTEXDIR and DVIDRVFONTS. The default
  built-in values are \emtex and \texfonts, respectively.

- Your emTeX is  N O T  installed in directory $(EMTEXDIR)
- Your file arrangements are somewhat individual
see next section 'Customizing dvips'




7.   C U S T O M I Z I N G   D V I P S
======================================

dvips is controlled by config files and environment variables. The 
submitted config.ps file uses (nearly) the same values as dvips has been 
compiled with. If you use emTeX with its environment variables EMTEXDIR
and DVIDRVFONTS set correctly, no changes might be necessary. For other 
environments, check which variables are refered to by config.ps and 
customizing of dvips is very easy, since (this) dvips supports...


7.1  Variable Expansion.

An entry ...$(FOO)... within a path entry of config.ps or a corresponding
environment variable is expanded into the contents of FOO. Don't worry 
about emTeX's special control character '!' in path names since (this) 
dvips supports ...


7.2  Searching files in subdirectories.

An '!' as last character of a path starts additional searching of files 
in the next subdirectory level. Two '!' introduce searching recursively
in all levels of subdirectories.
=======================================================================
        EXCEPT the path entries for individual pk fonts (pkpath).
=======================================================================

A valid entry for the tfm font files might be
        T $(TEXTFM)                     in config.ps or
        > set TEXFONTS=$(TEXTFM)        as environment variable
if TEXTFM contains 'C:\EMTEX\TFM!;d:\USR\TFM!!' for instance.

Don't forget to set up your default papersize as described in the last 
part of config.ps. The papersize affects upper and left margins of your 
output!



8.   S E T T I N G   U P   A   P R I N T E R 
============================================

dvips comes with a (built-in and predefined) setup for 300DPI laserjet 
printer, using US Letter paper. I added two additional example config 
files dj.cfg and lj4.cfg, which change the settings for using a 300DPI 
deskjet and 600DPI laserjetIV printer, both using A4 paper. Refer these 
files to see the interesting few parameters. These config files become
activated, when dvips is called with option '-P dj' or '-P ljh', respectively.
I'd like to recommend, that one should edit an own file dvips.ini, 
containing only the changes of values from config.ps for his/her default 
printer. dvips.ini is loaded after config.ps and I will newer include a 
dvips.ini file into the dvips distribution. I think, this is a relatively 
save and easy method for updates.

If your printer supports different paper trays, you might want to select
the papersize as PostScript code (the default (a4paper) only writes a
comment). This is done by the option -t a4, which can also be used in 
config files (without hyphen).



9.   S U P P O R T   O F   O T H E R   T E X   D I S T R I B U T I O N S
========================================================================

NOTE: The batch files and programs have been unzipped into \emtex\bin.
      You have to set your PATH entry pointing to that directory, too.

This part is a bit experimental. Please, be careful and send me any 
suggestions by email. Important for other TeX's is the following dvips 
related extract of the directory hierarchy of emTeX/dvips:

emTeX's directories         and contents

emtex\bin:                      binaries (*.exe *.bat *.cmd)
emtex\doc\dvips:                adjust.dvi dvips.dvi
emtex\data\dvips:               dvips config/header files
emtex\texinput\dvips:           dvips related *.tex *.sty
emtex\tfm\dvips:                dvips related *.tfm
texfonts\pixel.lj:              Pixel-Fonts for LaserJet, for instance:
                                texfonts\pixel.lj\300dpi\cmr10.pk
texfonts\vf:                    virtual Fonts (*.vf)

This knowledge should make you able to copy the diverse files into 
appropriate places of your distribution, but I would not recommend 
changes of the filesystem itself since there are mainly the following 
three disadvantages:

1. You have to do the same procedure (as last year...) when a new dvips 
becomes released.

2. You have to change the path names in the remove (*.rem) files for
being able to use emTeX's powerful 'emremove.exe' (not included).

3. Since tex and dvips can be controled by lots of parameters (files 
and/or settings), one can easily confuse the former working TeX/dvips 
system when changing a bit too much.

I modified the config.ps file, which now contains some additional entries 
for PCTeX. The following directory mappings have been assumed:

emTeX:                       -> PCTeX:

emtex/bin:                   -> pctex/bin
emtex/doc/dvips:             -> pctex/doc
emtex/data/dvips:            -> pctex/
emtex/texinput/dvips:        -> pctex/tex (*.tex) &  pctex/latex (*.sty)
emtex/tfm/dvips:             -> pctex/textfms
texfonts/pixel.lj:           -> pctex/pixel
  ..pixel.lj/300dpi/cmr10.pk ->   ..pixel/dpi300/cmr10.pk
 (../pixel.lj/%ddpi/%f.%p)   ->  (..pixel/dpi%d/%f.%p
texfonts/vf:                 -> ???

Please tell me your suggestions ...
I hope this helps a little using this dvips without emTeX.


I recieved a note about using dvips under TeXas by Joe Dewitte.
The document is included as /emtex/doc/dvips/4TeXas.txt



10.   A U T O M A T I C   G E N E R A T I O N   O F   F O N T S
===============================================================

10.1  a) maketexp.bat and maketexp.cmd

By default a batch file 'MakeTeXPK' becomes invoked when a font is 
missed. This fails normally, since DOS does not support such 'giant' file 
names. The command invoked by dvips can be set by the envirnoment 
variable 'MAKETEXPK':
        > SET MAKETEXPK=maketexp %n %d %b %m            (OS/2)
        > SET MAKETEXPK=maketexp %%n %%d %%b %%m        (DOS)
should do the job, where %n is a placeholder for font name, %d for 
required resolution, %b for basic resolution and %m for magnification.

The maketexp.bat/cmd you got with this version are just right to create 
fonts in this way. Possibly you have to change the batch file, if your 
font directory is not defined by %DVIDRVFONTS%\PIXEL.LJ or if you like 
to let mfjob create the tfm and log files also. By default the batch
files only write a file dvips.mfj for later use for the mfjob program. If
you want them to call mfjob to create the fonts 'on the fly', you have
to uncomment the lines
        REM mfjob dvips
        REM del dvips.mfj
just after
        echo Run "mfjob dvips"
at the bottom of maketexp.bat/cmd.


      b) make_pk.cmd

I have included an OS/2 REXX script make_pk.cmd, which works nearly
like maketexp.cmd, except that it calls ps2pk if a metafont source for a 
font couldn't be found. ps2pk creates a pk file from a PostScript Type-1 
font program and is availabe from 
        CTAN:/tex-archive/systems/os2/binaries/ps2pk.exe
The make_pk script may help those, who want to use PS fonts on a non-PS 
printer/previewer without GhostScript. To select this you have to
        > SET MAKETEXPK=make_pk %n %d %b %m             (OS/2 only !!!)
To let make_pk generate the missing PostScript fonts as pk files you need 
to deactivate dvips's reading of psfonts.map. This is done by the config.ps
option 'p nothing'. The dj.cfg file has been prepared for this task, you 
just have to remove the commenting asterisk. make_pk generates fonts for 
which it finds an entry in psfonts.map. The PostScript fonts (.pfb, .pfm) 
are expected to be in T1INPUTS which defaults to c:\psfonts.
This script produces some comments or error messages and one can easily 
see what goes wrong.
The script was originally written by Sebastian Rahtz,
        CTAN:/tex-archive/systems/os2/binaries/maketexpk.cmd
but he has no more the possibility to help with it.


10.2  dvidrv dvips16.exe  or  dvidrv dvips32.exe
The dvidrv of emTeX can be used for calling dvips; this is done by
        > dvidrv dvips16 <options> <file>
or
        > dvidrv dvips32 <options> <file>
If fonts go amiss, dvips reports this to dvidrv and dvidrv asks you
if you want to create the fonts. In this case, the metafont and collegues
affecting parameters set by the dvidrv program and should be correct.




11.  P S N F S S   A N D   D V I P S 
====================================

The following steps are required for typesetting LaTeX documents with
PostScript fonts.

(1) Install PSNFSS from tex-archive/macros/latex/packages/psnfss

(2) get the font files from tex-archive/psfonts/<foundry>/... 
(you'll find several subdirectories for each font <name>) and
install them in their appropriate places (.tfm, .vf, .map, .fd/.sty).
An example for Times:
 ../adobe/times/tfm/*.tfm       ->      %EMTEXDIR%\TFM\adobe
 ../adobe/times/vf/*.vf         ->      %TEXFONTS%\VF\adobe
 ../adobe/times/dvips/*.map     ->      %EMTEXDIR%\DATA\DVIPS
 ../adobe/times/sty/*.sty       ->      %EMTEXDIR%\TEXINPUT\PSNFSS
 ../adobe/times/sty/*.fd        ->      %EMTEXDIR%\TEXINPUT\PSNFSS

(3) make the fonts known for dvips by activating the fontmap file(s).
I recommend to remove all <shortname>.cfg or config.<shortname> files and 
to collect all *.map files into a single psnfss.map. I have done this 
already for all files in the <foundry>=adobe directory. The fontmap file 
psnfss.map is included in this distribution.
NOTE: I've done this for the betaversion of the metrics, be careful.
It has not been tested with the current version.

(4) copy the ../tools/8r.enc encoding description into the place dvips
looks for header files, i.e. \emtex\data\dvips

(5) For activating the psnfss.map file you can call dvips with the
additional commandline option -P psnfss which invokes loading of 
psnfss.cfg to make psnfss.map the current fontmap instead of psfonts.map.
Possibly you may want to use the psnfss.map always, just add a line
        p psnfss.map
to your preferred config file (config.ps, dvips.ini, etc.).


When you want to use a config file from the metrics distribution, you
should rename them like
        config.<shortname>      into            <shortname>.cfg
to let them be accessible for this DOSish dvips.

Special care must be taken for different style files with the same name.
Best may be to delete the .sty files from \emtex\texinputs\dvips.




12.   H Y P E R T E X   &   D V I P S
=====================================

On CTAN is some stuff available, called 'hypertex' in
        /tex-archive/support/hypertex
There are macros for plain and latex to support hyperlinks as 
\special{html:..} commands. dvips16.exe and dvips32.exe have been
compiled based on the sources of dvihps from this directory.

When using the hypertex option '-z' PostScript files become generated,
that can be converted to PDF files by Adobes distiller.

I have no access to a distiller program, but the -z option has been
succesfully tested by Tamas Bori.





13.   I N F O R M A T I O N   A B O U T   T H I S   V E R S I O N
=================================================================

dvips32.exe and dvips16.exe base mainly on sources by Thomas Rockicki (dvips)
and patches by Mark Doyle (HyperDVIPS).

The basic port to OS/2 and DOS was done by Russel Lang.

dvips16.exe has been compiled with MSC by Eberhard Mattes and dvips32.exe
with emx/gcc 0.9a(5) by myself, both containing many patches and improvements
with respect for good support of emTeX under DOS and OS/2.
  Former versions of dvips16 and code for directory expansion with
  Turbo-C were supported by Matthias Eckermann.

The source code for emtex's directory search routines (em*dir.{c,h}) was 
written and donated to the public domain by Eberhard Mattes .

Enjoy.                        Guido Sawade <sawade@physik.tu-berlin.de>




14.    M A I L I N G L I S T S
==============================

The 'dvips32' mailing list has been created for information about bugs 
and updates from me to its users. The list is intend for 'listening'
only. (You do not need to subscribe as subscriber of emtex-user, except
you like to act as a tester for prereleases :)

The 'emtex-user' mailing list is well known as *the* forum for news and
discussion about emtex itself and related problems.

Just write mail to Majordomo@physik.tu-berlin.de with the text
        INFO emtex-user
        INFO dvips32
        HELP
        END
in the body to get information about the lists and how to subscribe.




15.   H I S T O R Y
===================

V 1.2                   (dps5497b.zip, dps5497s.zip, dvipslib.zip)
initial release of dvips5.497
         
V 1.3                   (dps5499b.zip)
compiled with emx/gcc 08.h(9). squeeze.exe removed. dvips.bat/dvips.cmd 
changed. rsx.zip included (dvips32.exe runs under DOS-DPMI and Windows)

V 1.4                   (dps555b.zip, dps555s.zip, dvipslib.zip)
The new Version 5.55 of dvips is now available. The archives contain
now emTeX-style *.REM files for removal of all archive contents.

V 1.5                   (dps555b.zip, dps555s.zip)
A change in dvips.c has been necessary. Now dvips32.exe can be called by 
emTeX's dvidrv and the automatic font generation works correctly.

V 1.6                   (dps555b.zip, dps555s.zip)
Changed search.c allows now correct location of files which are specified 
by a complete path (like /mypics/data/plot1.eps). A newer rsx (now RSX32 
Beta4) is included.

V 1.7                   (dps558b.zip, dps558s.zip)
Now dvips-5.58. Bug in dvips.bat/dvips.cmd corrected. In dvips.bat/.cmd 
no default offset is set.

V 1.8                   (dps558b.zip, dps558s.zip)
emx/gcc0.9a(2) used: Supports 386 without copro! Not so much pre-sets in 
dvips.bat/cmd. config.ps supports PCTeX (I hope). RSX/EMX are now 
included as extra zip's, prevents for unwanted 'downdating' of already 
installed versions.

V 1.9                   (dps558b.zip, dps558s.zip)
(resident.c) Expanding of variables in dvips's environment and config.ps 
entries. Using a patched emx/gcc (Thanks to Eberhard Mattes) without the 
V1.8 -p/-l options affecting sscanf-Bug.
V 1.95                  (dps558b.zip, dps558s.zip)
(search.c) Expanding of subdirectories (one level only) when file search 
function finds '!' or '!!' at end of a search path.

V 2.00                  (dps558b.zip, dps558s.zip)
Bug in makefont.c corrected. The sources have been succesfully compiled 
with TURBO-C for 16Bit dvips by Matthias. (Many thanks for a long night, 
fighting with expanding subdirectories :) Changed dvips.tex which now 
creates the hidden 'DOS/OS2' parts of dvips.tex, due to a hint by Staszek
Wawrykiewicz.

V 2.10          10.3.95 (dps558b.zip, dps558s.zip)
Default setting of config.ps value 'P' (pk fonts search) works now as 
expected (makefile.saw). Bug in dvips.c (options -pj=, -pv=) corrected.

 LAST VERSION BEFORE CHANGING THE ARRANGEMENTS OF FILES AND ARCHIVE(S)
_______________________________________________________________________


V 2.2beta               (dvips.zip)
Many changes with respect to emTeX's new betatest release. File 
arrangements changed, default lasterjet  mode in config.ps changed. 
Additional lj4.cfg file for printing on 600 DPI LaserJetIV. BUG fixed: 
Stripping of long filenames containing a drive letter have been stripped 
too much :) in the past.

V 2.3beta       15.5.95 (dvipsexe.zip, dvipssrc.zip, dvipsfnt.zip)
Well, my decision of making only one archive introduced many, many mails. 
I give up, now again three parts, but named other :). Sebastian Rahtz' 
maketexpk.cmd as make_pk.cmd included. Experimental dvihps32.exe 
included. Again: changes in maketexp.* and dvips.*. Subdirectory 
expansion bug corrected (didn't expand dirnames containing '.'). The 
16Bit executables (dvi(h)ps16.exe, afm2tfm.x16) are now included, while 
the EMX and RSX packages are not.

V 2.4..2.45  unpublished

V 2.5           30.10.95 (dvipsini.zip, dvipssrc.zip, dvipsfnt.zip)
Some cosmetics. Now compiled based on dvihps sources. Some aid for
PSNFSS added. Missing fonts message is more clearly (for None-UNIX 
people). dvips.{bat,cmd} removed. emtex searching routines implemented. 
LaserJet IV config file renamed to ljh.cfg (formerly lj4.cfg).
Redirection of stderr facillity for DOS users. Debug output (-d 2) improved.
Many thanks to the alpha testing staff, especially Santiago Vila Doncel who 
made several helpfull suggestions on the dvips.doc and to Eberhard Mattes for 
the 16bit version and his emtex directory routines.
